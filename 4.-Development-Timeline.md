## Walk before you can run

While a major aim of the game is to allow players to build spaceships and explore the galaxy, there is no point to this if the experience found on planets is dull and lacks variety.

Therefore, before we get to space, it is important from a development standpoint to make sure the gameplay found on planets is good enough to stand on its own.

The immediate goal is to make a planetary exploration game revolving around a single planet where players can mine for resources, build and interact with other players. Once this reaches a level of maturity where it is playable and enjoyable, then the components to allow space travel will be developed and added into the game.

### Stage 1

_[At some point during Stage 1, an early-access launch should be considered]_

1. Develop a planet-bound exploration game with resource management, building tools and basic survival mechanics
2. Add multiplayer elements
3. Build out a library of components and modules used for building and decorating your environment
4. Add NPCs/possible sources of danger
5. Improve planetary system to include weather, better procedural generation, realistic terrain formation

### Stage 2

1. Add vehicular travel
2. Add assets that allow flight to be possible
3. Allow flight to nearby celestial bodies, eg, the 'home' planet could have a moon that can be explored
4. Set up procedurally-generated star systems for deeper space travel and decide on the mode of transport when travelling extremely vast distances (light years)
5. Set up a distributed server system where solar systems (or even individual planets or portions of planets) can be run on separate servers, but everything exists within the same galaxy. This opens the door for private servers with their own set of rules and assets, but still allow them to join the main Itinerant universe.

### Stage 3

1. Launch of initial game - _see section 5. Initial Setting for more information_.
