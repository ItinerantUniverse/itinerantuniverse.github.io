# Objectives for the player

Itinerant literally means ‘traveling from place to place’, and the game will encourage players to explore and interact with the world around them.

While many open world sandbox games focus on base-building in static locations, Itinerant will place an emphasis on letting the player create vehicles they can use to travel around in. While a player’s base can still be a building on a planet (should they find a nice location they want to call home), the goal should be around the idea of the player’s base being a spaceship that they can explore the galaxy in – allowing them to continually customize, modify, repair, upgrade and expand their spaceship as they progress through the game.

Players will also be able to interact with other players in the game. Since it is assumed running a spaceship, especially if it is particularly large, might become complex and time-consuming, it could be in players’ interests to team up together and build one vessel they can all call home. In other scenarios, perhaps certain players are more interested in building modules or scripting code (for example, designing better navigation computers or displays that interact with sensors found in the game) – these players could potentially trade their inventions with other players or sell unique/limited-edition items if an in-game currency exists.

You will also have to be prepared to defend yourself against other players and NPCs, either alone or with your friends.

Whilst not offering a fully-blown RPG-style experience (the emphasis should be on the stories the players create themselves by playing the game), the Itinerant engine will be capable of supporting story-like content to provide the player with new mini-challenges from time-to-time. These will take a form similar to episodic sci-fi television programmes where the player can dip in and out at will. However, this portion of the game is entirely dependent on budget availability and therefore is considered more a feature for down-the-line, post initial launch.
