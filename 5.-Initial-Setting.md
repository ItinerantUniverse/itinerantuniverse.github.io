# Initial Setting

## Starting the game

Whilst numerous opening scenarios could be presented to the user in the future, the initial plan is to place the player on an asteroid in the outer reaches of a solar system – similar to the Kuiper Belt around our own Solar System.

The asteroids in this belt are rich in minerals and resources, however they are a barren and very inhospitable place with extremely low temperatures and very little sunlight. Surviving in this environment will be tough, and the player will most likely want to leave to find a more hospitable environment.

Whilst the setting should be relatively vague to begin with (is the player in our own Solar System? Is it the future? The past? Why is the player here? Are they human or something else?), the inference will be that they have been awoken or ‘generated’ on an abandoned mining facility which has some barely-functional equipment, basic accommodation and the ability to mine for some resources – perhaps the computer systems on the facility have awoken the player so that they can perform some necessary repairs or manually collect resources to keep everything running?

The player will be able to ‘hop’ from asteroid to asteroid (possibly almost quite literally – asteroids have very little gravity and it would therefore be physically possible to jump off one celestial body to land on another), collecting parts and mining resources to try to stay alive.

## Initial Progress

Scattered across the belt are the remains of a large intergalactic starship of unknown origin, which either crashed or was purposely dismantled (perhaps a bit of both). The technology has been repurposed to be used in much of the mining equipment that the user finds. Everything can be interacted with – for example, the mining facility itself isn’t some hard-coded monolith that cannot be tampered or interfered with (like a vault in Fallout) – it’s a collection of components providing tolerable gravity, temperature and atmospheric conditions. The player is free to dismantle the setup and see how it effects the environment around them. If they die, they will respawn in the initial location – unless it is now uninhabitable, in which case they will respawn somewhere else.

_[Note: Respawn ‘devices’ in-game are part of the universe that will have an explainable reason for existing and can be interacted with by the player – for example it might make sense for the player to take the respawn chamber they first arrived in and put it in their spaceship, or perhaps they’ll just scavenge it for parts and try not to die!]_

By collecting parts of the ancient starship while discovering potential mining locations, it will become evident to the player that it is possible to manually build their own spaceship – the design of which is entirely down to them. Salvageable parts found by the player will be scattered randomly throughout the asteroid belt, meaning that no two run-throughs of the initial game setup will be the same. While the game has a finite number of base modules and meshes available to give the player, there will be no ‘right’ way to build a spaceship and each play-through will result in a unique vehicle being built.
